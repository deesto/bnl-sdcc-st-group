  - Killing processes with CVMFS mounts and wiping client cache releived high load instantly
- ATLAS: another issue with WNs upgrade to CVMFS 2.11.5 found with [SQlite catalog errors](https://github.com/cvmfs/cvmfs/issues/3628#issuecomment-2331757572), seems to have caused ~200 ATLAS job failures within one hour
  - Progress being tracked in [a new issue report](https://github.com/cvmfs/cvmfs/issues/3659)

  - All mounts needed to be un/re-mounted individually
  - Scripts deployed by farm on nodes to auto-mount [via puppet](https://webdocs.sdcc.bnl.gov/repos/puppet/puppet/src/branch/production/linuxfarm/farm/manifests/resources.pp) don't seem to work

- Belle II: learned that the GS group [decommissioned](https://racfjira.atlassian.net/browse/SIG-4) the OKD instance in which Belle II (and EPIC) were testing CDB migration and planning to migrate from current deployment
  - No consutation with or announcement to Belle II or EPIC, because the instance was owned by ATLAS, and ATLAS T1 reps OKed the decommissioning
  - GS group propose Belle II move to the [RHIC OKD instance](https://console-openshift-console.apps.rcf.bnl.gov/) while OpenShift is prepared for production (possibly next month)

- Belle II: [HSF CDB panel review](https://indico.bnl.gov/event/24046/) document preparation, review, meeting (11 Jul)
- Belle II: continued troubleshooting of problematic conditions metadata requests from Trieste site proxy
  - Testing of jobs submitted to grid (versus local submission at Trieste) delayed by world-wide issues, but completed successfully with no strain on metadata services
  - Also found problematic period (4:59-5:18am 11 Jul) during which [89k metadata requests from DESY in 19 minutes](https://monitoring.sdcc.bnl.gov/pub/grafana/d/b2cdb-gt-access/client-global-tag-access?orgId=1&from=1720688351289&to=1720689478301) slowed metadata response times [to >40s](https://monitoring.sdcc.bnl.gov/grafana/d/CGFE-OYGz/cdb-ha-monitor?orgId=1&var-host=blcond03.sdcc.bnl.gov&var-host=blcond04.sdcc.bnl.gov&var-proxy=All&var-sv=All&from=1720688351289&to=1720689478301&viewPanel=25)
    - Another similar load from DESY (12:15-12:20 11 Jul) of 22k requests in 5 minutes pushed metadata response times over one minute

  - Some users having problems with expired VO memberships despite valid contracts; require manual fixes in IAM
- ATLAS: continued investigation of CVMFS client issues at other sites (AGLT2, NET2)
- Belle II: troubleshooting of problematic conditions metadata requests from Trieste site proxy continues
  - Squid reconfiguration, redeployment (as Frontier Squid) did not solve issues as thought previously

  - First clear attempt failed with [missing lock file in transaction](https://rt.racf.bnl.gov/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=36960#txn-1109739)
  - Subsequent sync during publication affected by user changing files in publication area during transaction, similar changes during previous transaction likely caused initial hang
